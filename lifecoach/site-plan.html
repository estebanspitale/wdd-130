        Color Palette

      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      Palette URL: <a href="https://coolors.co/412cb6-cc0066-fab617-49152e" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/412cb6-cc0066-fab617-49152e</a>


      <table class="colors">
        <tr><th>Primary</th><th>Secondary</th><th>Accent 1</th><th>Accent 2</th></tr>
        <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
        <tr><td class="primary">#412CB6</td><td class="secondary">#CC0066</td><td class="accent1">#FAB617</td><td class="accent2">#49152E</td></tr>

      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->
      I chose these colors that combine with the ones I have in the logo and between them as well.
      I think they are legible and pleasing to the eye.

        Our goal is your success. We offer one-on-one, group and entrepreneurial 
        coaching programs to help people realize their potential and live their 
        lives more fully. Work connects people with themselves so they can understand 
        what's important to them, investigate the resources available to them in the 
        environments in which they thrive, and make powerful and resonant decisions to 
        build a life of greater happiness and success by achieving their personal, group, 
        and work goals. The people we work with are already successful. They are creative, 
        challenging, and ambitious. They only come to us to deepen and expand their thinking 
        and explore more than they are capable of. This work invites you to see yourself more 
        fully, evaluate what old options are no longer useful and what new options will 
        serve you to move forward on this path that we are all traveling.

      <h3>LifeCoaching</h3>
      <p>
        Life coaching is one of the most widespread coaching modalities. Its object of study 
        is the person as such, their emotions, and feelings, and as in the other branches, 
        it proposes a dialectical relationship between the coach and the coachee based on 
        feedback. A coach is not only useful when facing personal or emotional problems. 
        A coach is above all a facilitator who can be present in family, affective, 
        professional, or work processes.
So that you can better understand, here are some common situations in which a person 
could benefit from a life coach:

• 	When starting a new project: You would be surprised to know the large number of entrepreneurs who seek support and advice before launching a new company.
• 	When we face situations of change: Many people do not know how to deal with difficult situations such as job loss, divorce, or bereavement.
• 	Search for direction in professional goals: Life coaching also helps professionals clarify their goals and carry out concrete actions to achieve them.
• 	Lack of motivation: People do not always have enough motivation to follow their goals. Motivational life coaching seeks to restore confidence and security to each person, two key elements in any process.
• 	Promoting new talents: Many people have a specific skill that they don't know how to carry out. A life coach helps facilitate those resources and thus bring out other skills.
• 	When we want to eradicate destructive patterns: Negativity, pessimism, lack of interest, fear of change and inflexibility are aspects that prevent the achievement of objectives. The role of a coach is to eradicate these barriers and make the coachee aware of the vitality of reversing these thoughts.

All these reasons are enough for you to use life coaching as a support tool. The essence of 
these practices is the presence of an external gaze that helps you get answers about your own life.

      <h3>Sessions</h3>
      <p>
        If you want to elevate your goals, achieve your goals, and broaden your horizons 
        by moving toward a fuller, more fulfilling life, we can begin working together 
        with an initial phone contact who will have 30 minutes to clarify what to expect, 
        talk about your goals, answer your questions, and experience a short training session. 
        Only if after this call you feel at ease, we can work together constructively and 
        establish a new commitment. Life coaching sessions can be on Zoom, Teams, some other 
        platform, over the phone, or in person, depending on what you feel can serve you best 
        and fits other existing commitments. Tasks and consultations will be carried out that 
        are meant to deepen the new awareness gained in the sessions and establish positive 
        habits as you move from where you were to where you want to be. The duration of the 
        process is subject to the evolution that we have in each session. Throughout the 
        training program, cross-session support is offered with short check-ins, emails, 
        and messages. My goal is to keep the space where you can safely explore how you want 
        to be in the world and what factors, both internal and external, are preventing it.
