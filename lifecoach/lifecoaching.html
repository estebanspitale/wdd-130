                <p>Life coaching is one of the most widespread coaching modalities. Its object of study 
                    is the person as such, their emotions, and feelings, and as in the other branches, 
                    it proposes a dialectical relationship between the coach and the coachee based on 
                    feedback. A coach is not only useful when facing personal or emotional problems. 
                    A coach is above all a facilitator who can be present in family, affective, 
                    professional, or work processes.

                <p>So that you can better understand, here are some common situations in which a person 
                    could benefit from a life coach:
                    
                    • 	When starting a new project: You would be surprised to know the large number of entrepreneurs who seek support and advice before launching a new company.
                    • 	When we face situations of change: Many people do not know how to deal with difficult situations such as job loss, divorce, or bereavement.
                    • 	Search for direction in professional goals: Life coaching also helps professionals clarify their goals and carry out concrete actions to achieve them.
                    • 	Lack of motivation: People do not always have enough motivation to follow their goals. Motivational life coaching seeks to restore confidence and security to each person, two key elements in any process.
                    • 	Promoting new talents: Many people have a specific skill that they don't know how to carry out. A life coach helps facilitate those resources and thus bring out other skills.
                    • 	When we want to eradicate destructive patterns: Negativity, pessimism, lack of interest, fear of change and inflexibility are aspects that prevent the achievement of objectives. The role of a coach is to eradicate these barriers and make the coachee aware of the vitality of reversing these thoughts.</p>

            <p>All these reasons are enough for you to use life coaching as a support tool. The essence of 
                these practices is the presence of an external gaze that helps you get answers about your own life.
