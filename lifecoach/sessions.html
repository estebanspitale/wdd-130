            <p class="sessions-msg">If you want to elevate your goals, achieve your goals, and broaden your horizons 
                by moving toward a fuller, more fulfilling life, we can begin working together 
                with an initial phone contact who will have 30 minutes to clarify what to expect, 
                talk about your goals, answer your questions, and experience a short training session. 
                Only if after this call you feel at ease, we can work together constructively and 
                establish a new commitment. Life coaching sessions can be on Zoom, Teams, some other 
                platform, over the phone, or in person, depending on what you feel can serve you best 
                and fits other existing commitments. Tasks and consultations will be carried out that 
                are meant to deepen the new awareness gained in the sessions and establish positive 
                habits as you move from where you were to where you want to be. The duration of the 
                process is subject to the evolution that we have in each session. Throughout the 
                training program, cross-session support is offered with short check-ins, emails, 
                and messages. My goal is to keep the space where you can safely explore how you want 
                to be in the world and what factors, both internal and external, are preventing it.
